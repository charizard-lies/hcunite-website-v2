            <p class="centered-text-block mt-6 ">
                Hi everyone! We’re the 51st Hwa Chong Students’ Council (HCSC). 
                As a passionate cohort of 50 Councillors who have received the mandate from our peers, to serve our school and more importantly, our student body. 
                Our Council comprises the Non-Standing Executive Committee (NSE), Executive Committee (ExCo), Extended Council Attaché Committee (ECACo), 
                Publications and Publicity Committee (PubCo), Social and Relations Committee (S&R), Student Engagement and Culture Committee (SECCo) and Welfare Committee (WelCo). 
                No two committees are identical, yet all are equally indispensable to the day-to-day functionings of the Council. 
                <br><br>Since its inception in 1973, the Council has strived to make the JC experience a memorable one for everyone, and Hwa Chong a home for all. 
                We want to be the voice that represents you - the students. 
                We pledge to always carry out our responsibilities to the best of our ability, working as one for the interest of the school, 
                and the welfare of the students, being the pinnacle of leadership our school has to offer. 
                How? Beyond planning Hwa Chong’s 7 annual flagship events, we also stay connected with students, both past and present, through our social media page @HCUnite and our website. 
                We also keep our school spirit strong through the teaching and leading of our school’s Song, Dance and Cheers (abbreviated into SODACHE). 
                The elements of SODACHE were conceived and passed down by generations of seniors who walked this campus before us, and still remain a staple in our Hwa Chong tradition today. 
                <br><br>At the end of the day, we hope to help forge our shared Hwa Chong identity, in this vibrant community that we all call our home. 
                As always, we aim to embody the school’s vision, to Live with Passion and Lead with Compassion.
                The HCSC - by students, for students.
